## Projects

- **[Quantium-Data-Analytics](https://github.com/reuel97/Quantium-Data-Analytics)**: I participated in Quantium's job simulation on the Forage platform. I worked on a project to conduct analyses on a client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations. I used Python and built my Data Visualisation skills in a real-world context.
  
- **[KPMG-AU-Data-Analytics](https://github.com/reuel97/KPMG-AU-Data-Analytics)**: I participated in KPMG's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on the Data, Analytics & Modelling team at KPMG. I worked on a project to advise a client on customer targeting and I practiced assessing data quality, garnering insights, and creating dashboards in a real-world context.
  
- **[Commonwealth-Bank-Introduction-to-Data-Science](https://github.com/reuel97/Commonwealth-Bank-Introduction-to-Data-Science)**: I participated in Commonwealth Bank's job simulation on the Forage platform, I worked on a project to create a data engineering pipeline to aggregate and extract insights from a data set. I practiced using Python and built my data analysis skills in a real-world context.
  
- **[Accenture-North-America-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization](https://github.com/reuel97/Accenture-North-America-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization)**: I participated in Accentureâ€™s Data Analytics & Visualization job simulation on the Forage platform, I used Excel, Python and visualization skills in a realistic context.
  
- **[BCG-X-Data-Science](https://github.com/reuel97/BCG-X-Data-Science)**: I participated in BCG's Data Science job simulation on the Forage platform, I worked on a project to create a customer churn analysis simulation using Python. This project built my data science skills in a real-world context, as well as my presentation skills through creating an executive summary of my findings for the team.
  
- **[British-Airways-Data-Science](https://github.com/reuel97/British-Airways-Data-Science)**: I participated in British Airway's job simulation on the Forage platform, I worked on a project where I analysed customer insights and built a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour. I practiced my data analytics skills using a Jupyter Notebook and built my Presentation and communication skills by presenting insights in a real-world context.
  
- **[Tata-Data-Visualisation-Empowering-Business-with-Effective-Insights](https://github.com/reuel97/Tata-Data-Visualisation-Empowering-Business-with-Effective-Insights)**: I participated in Tata's job simulation on the Forage platform, I worked on a project to help a retail client review their revenue data to prepare for the future. I created data visuals using Tableau to present information, and built my presentation skills in a real-world context.
